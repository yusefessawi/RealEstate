Real Estate Projects using Python to build estimators of home value and market growth in Northern Virginia. 

 ### Welcome to my real estate repository! I am excited to have you here. 

 As of the beginning of 2022, foreclosures are on the rise. Coupled with the fact that home purchases tends to be the largest purchase a person makes in their lifetime, it can be unfortunate to make a mistake when purchasing a home. Foreclosures, market volatility, and prejudice are among main concerns regarding real estate transactions. Such reasons compell better resources to help people navigate real estate transactions.
 
 Assessing real estate value is the root of such problems - both real estate professionals and homeowners may miscalculate home value in ways that have negative consequences for themselves and others. For example, formal appraisals have many use cases including selling a home, refinancing a home, obtaining a home equity loan, etc. This gives appraisers incredible power when assesing property values, as personal biases of the appraiser can generate prejudice that negatively affects a household. This scenario has been detailed for decades, often by members of marginalized groups who recieve unexplicably low property appraisals despite higher-valued comparable properties. Additionally, rampant inflation and speculations of a recession suggest that overpaying for a property may have poor ramifications in such an expensive world.
 
 Foreclosures are often a worst-case scenario among real estate problems, the better case scenario of making prudent real estate decisions can help households achieve financial security. *There is a promising, data-driven way to view real estate,* which is afforded by software engineering methods! There is an abundance of real estate data that is available at a low cost, giving hope to these real estate problems.
 
 ### Objectives:
 1. Build a predictor of price that uses comparable sold properties and not price history/ formal appraisals
 2. Implement a machine learning model to increase accuracy of predictor
 3. Use external API's to extract data and use data wrangling methods to prepare dataset for analysis and data science methods
 4. Expand analysis to most of Fairfax County to elucidate potential shortcomings of the model (ex. where linear relationship may not be sufficient)

 ### Why Does this project exist: 
 1. To design pragmatic real estate predictors based on recently sold properties
 2. To provide insight that may help individuals in unfortunate situations, such as foreclosure
 3. To expand the reach of data science into real estate

 Given that homes tend to be the largest asset that people purchase in their lifetime, a lot of data is present on houses. While much of this data may be inaccessible, APIs can be used, and large corporations (ex. Redfin, Realtor.com, etc.) may make data available online. Regarding homebuyer decisions - while emotional connections and gut feelings can be important when purchasing a home, there are more objective factors relating to a home (lot size, home size, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) that may be important to consider in terms of home value. It can be speculated that if a family is ever in a financial pinch, the ability to sell a home quickly and for the highest price will provide relief and prevent devastating processes such as foreclosures.
